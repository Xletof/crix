# Smoke tests

Headless Playwright driving the real game against the Vite dev server. There is
no unit-test layer and no test framework — each file is a standalone script that
boots the game, does something, measures it, and exits non-zero if the
measurement is wrong.

```bash
npm run dev            # in one shell — the tests need :5173 up
npm run smoke          # in another
npm run smoke -- --only cluster,flight
```

`run-all.mjs` runs them **sequentially on purpose**. Several reposition enemies,
pause physics or stop the game loop to take a measurement; in parallel they
would corrupt each other's world state.

## The files

**Assertions** — exit non-zero on failure, and are what "the suite passes" means.

| File | What it protects |
|---|---|
| `smoke-arc.mjs` | Cluster canister pops *above* the burst before descending |
| `smoke-boost.mjs` | Booster SFX sustains for the whole dive instead of blipping |
| `smoke-cluster.mjs` | Munitions lock **distinct** targets, flat scale, no ground phase, guidance lines cleaned up, generic hit beep suppressed |
| `smoke-debug.mjs` | Debug menu actions actually apply *and* the HUD re-syncs |
| `smoke-depth.mjs` | Airborne objects draw over the room; nose tracks travel (no tumble) |
| `smoke-flight.mjs` | The attack run banks, arrives under power, honours both speed caps, lights its exhaust |
| `smoke-hum.mjs` | Saber hum carries in the band a phone speaker can reproduce |
| `smoke-leak.mjs` | Primary fire is isolated from the cluster (no pool cross-talk) |

**Diagnostics** — print numbers, no pass/fail. Run directly, not via `run-all`.

| File | Use it when |
|---|---|
| `diag-flight.mjs` | A munition is missing: per-munition flight time, closest approach, end altitude |
| `smoke-audio.mjs` | Comparing SFX levels across the mix |
| `smoke-fragsfx.mjs` | Judging impact-sound *timbre* (low band vs crack band), not just loudness |
| `shot-run.mjs` | Capturing a frame sequence across a whole attack run → `tests/out/` |

## Environment

Two paths are hardcoded in every file because this container provides them:

```
/opt/node22/lib/node_modules/playwright/index.mjs      # import source
/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome     # executablePath
```

The chromium directory is **version-stamped and will change**. If every test
suddenly fails to launch, that is why:

```bash
ls -d /opt/pw-browsers/chromium-*                      # find the new one
sed -i 's|chromium-1194|chromium-XXXX|g' tests/*.mjs
```

## Things this harness will lie to you about

Every one of these produced a *false pass* in this project at some point. They
are the reason the tests are written the way they are.

**Headless runs at ~20 FPS.** Phaser `TimerEvent`s resolve coarsely — a bare
`delayedCall(70)` measures 150–220ms. Use generous waits. That is a harness
artifact, not a game bug.

**`page.evaluate` polling misses fast events.** A round trip costs 200–400ms, so
polling a ~900ms flight collects 2–5 samples and can miss an entire phase. Sample
from *inside* the page with a `postupdate` hook instead — it sees every frame and
costs nothing. This is what every flight test does.

**`b.y` is not where the object is.** Anything airborne renders at
`groundY - altitude`, so measuring distance or curvature against `b.y` silently
folds in up to 560px of altitude. It reports a munition directly above an enemy
as 560px away. Use `b.groundY` (set every frame in the fragment's `draw()`), and
recover altitude as `groundY - y` when you need it. This bug has now been fixed
twice, in `smoke-flight` and `smoke-arc` — in the second case it made the test
pass standalone and fail in the suite on an identical build.

**Fractional sampling of short sounds reports silence as "quiet".** Sampling an
envelope at a fraction of its expected length lands past the end of a sound that
stopped early, and the analyser dutifully returns a low number that looks like a
pass. Sample at **fixed millisecond offsets** from the call — see
`smoke-boost.mjs`.

**A pooled object's identity is not its liveness.** `active` cannot distinguish
"still my bullet" from "recycled and re-fired as something else". Guard deferred
callbacks with the `_gen` token, which `Bullet.fire()` bumps.

**Loudness is not timbre.** "It got quieter" and "it changed shape" are different
claims. To support a claim about character, measure *band ratios* — see
`smoke-fragsfx.mjs` (low body vs crack band) and `smoke-hum.mjs` (sub vs
phone-audible band).

**Index 0 of a live group is not a stable object.** `group.getChildren()[0]`
changes identity as members die, so frame-to-frame diffing of `arr[0]` compares
different objects. Key per-object state off the object itself.

## Rules that keep these honest

1. **A/B any measurement against the pre-change build** (`git stash`) before
   trusting it. If the test does not *fail* on the old code, it is not testing
   your change. The `smoke-hum` numbers in `HANDOVER.md` were obtained this way.
2. **Screenshot it.** This project is heavily visual and several past "passing"
   tests were wrong assertions rather than working code. For FX under ~150ms,
   freeze first: `scene.tweens.timeScale = 0` and `physics.world.pause()`, then
   capture.
3. **If a test fails intermittently, fix the measurement, not the threshold.**
   Both intermittent failures found here were real measurement bugs.
